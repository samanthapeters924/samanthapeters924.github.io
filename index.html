I'm Samantha Peters and am a student in the Web Design track at Startup Institute Boston</p>

<p>I have an affinity for technology, and fell in love with coding after graduating from college. Now, I'm building my skills in front-end web development so that I can grow in a career that I'll love. I want to work with a smart, savvy team, contributing to a product that I believe in.</p>

<p>Originally from southern Louisiana, I moved to Boston in August 2014. I'm passionaate about travel, love dining out, cooking, and like to start my day with Eggo waffles for breakfast.</p>
